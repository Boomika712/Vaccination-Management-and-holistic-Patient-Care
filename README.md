# CareSync+ Comprehensive Digital Platform for Vaccination Management and holistic Patient Care

The current vaccination management systems are primarily focused on pediatric care, leaving significant gaps in services for adults, seniors, and individuals with chronic conditions who require ongoing vaccinations. 
Furthermore, the lack of integration with Electronic Health Records (EHR) results in fragmented healthcare management, particularly for elderly patients needing continuous monitoring and personalized care. 
This project addresses these issues by developing a comprehensive digital platform that provides tailored vaccination schedules for all age groups, integrates seamlessly with EHRs, and enhances access to comprehensive healthcare services, including real-time synchronization and web/mobile accessibility.

## Methodology

The platform includes the development of a user-friendly mobile app, utilizing advanced technologies for efficient healthcare delivery.

### Mobile Application Development
The mobile application is built using Flutter providing personalized vaccination schedules, reminders, and a paramedical professional search feature for users. VS Studio is employed for development and debugging.

Firebase ensures real-time data synchronization, user authentication, and notifications, enabling timely vaccination reminders and access to professional profiles.
